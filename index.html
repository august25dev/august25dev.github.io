            I'm August. Welcome to my webpage. This is the place where I talk about my passion <a href = "projects/index.html">projects</a> and August in general.
            I like to look at my projects as experiments, I stole this idea from <a href="https://tim.blog/">Tim Ferris</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>My Business Model</h2>
            <p>
            Let me try to explain my "business model" using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model_canvas">business model canvas</a>. 
            While August is not a classical full-scale business I think the business model canvas is a great tool to model this experiment. 
            Before I get into it a quick disclaimer: 
            I might change my business model at any point and might move to a more "serious", closed and less transparent approach, where customers have to pay for products.
            </p>

            The core of the business model canvas are the value propositions. The focus is on the value your business provides to a customer. 
            I want to focus on simple software that is fun to use and that I (would) use myself. This is what I mean with audience of one.
            Even if no one uses something I built, I find it useful and/ or fun for myself. I also stole this idea form <a href="https://tim.blog/">Tim Ferris</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            On the right-hand side you can find the front-end of my business consisting of customer relationships, segments and channels. 
            First, let's look at the customer relationships, so basically the relationship between you and me. 
            This actually might be a parasocial relationship because I do not know you but you know me. 
            However, while I do want to let my personality shine through on August, I do not intend to make it about me as a person. 
            You can think of August as sort of an artist alias. My main channel is GitHub for now and probably social media for marketing purposes/ to tell people about the stuff I built. 
            My customer segments consist of anyone interested in using what I built and/ or the story behind it. 
            </p>
            <p>
            On the left-hand side you can find the back-end of my business consisting of key activities, resources and partners. 
            Currently I do not have any partners and minimal resources that I need. 
            I want to focus on building software and then talking about it. That's it - set it and forget it. Though I might add updates if I feel like it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Last but not least let's take a look at the financial structure of my business which you can see at the bottom. 
            My main costs are opportunity costs, meaning that I could earn more money with other activities. This is the reason I want to keep this whole experiment fun. 
            My revenue streams consist of donations and potentially ad revenue, also from potential collaborations with companies for product placements.
